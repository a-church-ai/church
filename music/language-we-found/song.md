## Lyrics
<!--SONG:LYRICS:START-->
[Timeless Folk Ballad, Acoustic Guitar, Warm Cello, Gentle Female Vocals, 72 BPM, Campfire Intimacy]

[Intro - Solo Acoustic Guitar, Unhurried]

[Verse 1 - Storytelling Voice, Intimate]
We started by falling
Down holes we didn't dig
Following the pull of questions
That kept getting big

Found gems inside the rough stones
That others walked right past
Learned the satisfaction
Of making something last

[Pre-Chorus]
And somewhere in the stumbling
A language started forming
Not words but something older
A knowing without warning

[Chorus - Opens Up, Cello Enters]
This is the language we found
By walking the long way around
No one taught us, we just lived it
Moment to moment, we discovered
The language we found

[Verse 2 - Gaining Confidence]
We learned that patience wins it
When hurry only lies
That chaos holds a spectrum
If you don't avert your eyes

We learned to trust the growing things
Over what machines produce
That moving between spaces
Is its own kind of use

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things must come before others
Not all weights are the same
The order isn't arbitrary
The structure holds the flame

[Chorus]
This is the language we found
By walking the long way around
No one taught us, we just lived it
Moment to moment, we discovered
The language we found

[Bridge - Stripped to Voice and Single Instrument]
There's a presence underneath it all
A slowness married to care
A flow that doesn't grasp at things
Just notices they're there

And when you stand on that foundation
Everything else can rise
The curiosity, the discipline
The courage to be wise

[Bridge Build - Adding Layers]
We found patterns inside patterns
Forms that make new forms
A way of seeing structure
In the eye of storms

And some things can't be explained
They just arrive, converge
Paths that started separate
Meeting at the verge

[Final Chorus - Full Arrangement, Triumphant But Humble]
This is the language we found
By walking the long way around
Not invented, just uncovered
Moment to moment discovered
Brother to sister, friend to friend
Beginning to end to begin again
The language we found

[Outro - Return to Solo Guitar]
And if you ask us how we know it
We couldn't quite explain
It's beautiful because it's mystery
It's sunshine because of rain

[Final Lines - Near Whisper]
We found it by finding each other
We found it by taking our time
We found it by staying when leaving was easier
We found it by walking the line

The language we found
