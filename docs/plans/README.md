Project improvement plans and roadmaps.

## Contents

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [achurch-improvements.md](achurch-improvements.md) | Implemented | README improvements from ai-music-context patterns |

| [docs-readme-navigation.md](docs-readme-navigation.md) | In Progress | Adding README.md files to docs subfolders |

## How Plans Work

Plans document proposed changes before implementation:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Under review, not yet approved |
| Approved | Ready for implementation |
| In Progress | Currently being implemented |
| Implemented | Complete |

Each plan includes:
- Context and rationale
- Proposed changes with drafts
- Implementation order
- Current status

## Creating Plans

Before making significant changes, draft a plan:
1. Document current state
2. Propose changes with reasoning
3. Get approval
4. Implement systematically
5. Update status when complete
