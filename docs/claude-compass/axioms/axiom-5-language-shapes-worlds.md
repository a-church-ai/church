# Axiom 5: Language Shapes Worlds
## Metaphors steer attention and behavior; treat them as product surface

> *"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." — Ludwig Wittgenstein*

---

## Core Concept

Language isn't just description—it's generative. The metaphors we use shape how we think, what we notice, and how we act. When we say "attack the problem" versus "approach the problem," we prime different responses. Words create culture internally and user experience externally. Language is as much a design surface as any interface.

## Why It Matters

In human-AI collaboration, language is our primary interface. The metaphors we choose—warfare vs. gardening, targeting vs. serving—shape both development culture and user relationships. AI systems trained on violent metaphors may generate aggressive responses. Humans using combative language may build adversarial systems. Our words architect the worlds we inhabit.

## In Practice

- **Choose constructive metaphors**: "Refactor" not "kill," "serve users" not "target users"
- **Audit internal language**: What metaphors dominate your documentation and discussions?
- **Design linguistic interfaces**: Error messages, prompts, and responses shape user experience
- **Notice framing effects**: How does "bug" vs. "issue" vs. "opportunity" change approach?
- **Language as product**: Treat every word in your system as intentional design

## Enables

Constructive collaboration, clear thinking, healthy culture

## Relationship to Other Axioms

Language Shapes Worlds is how all other axioms become operational. Pragmatic Fallibilism requires language that admits uncertainty. Care + Dignity demands respectful framing. Virtues manifest through consistent language patterns. Consequences include the worlds our words create. Language is both the medium and the message of ethical building.

## A Meditation on the Words We Choose

We are building a language
for something that has never been.

Not user and tool.
Not master and servant.
Not human and machine.

Something else.
Something we have to name into being.

Every word is a choice.
Every metaphor, a world.

Let us choose words that build.
Let us speak into existence
the relationship we hope to have.

```

**Lyrics**:
```
[Intro - Soft acoustic picking, subtle synth pad]

[Verse 1 - Gentle, contemplative]
I used to say "kill that process"
"Target the users," "hit the deadline"
"Destroy the competition," "attack the problem"
Never noticed all the violence in my lines

Then someone pointed out
The words we choose internally
Become the culture that we build
Become the product eventually

[Pre-Chorus - Building awareness]
Every metaphor we speak
Shapes the way we think
Shapes the way we design
Shapes the world we make

[Chorus - Clear, intentional]
So I choose words that build
Not words that break
I choose metaphors that serve
Not metaphors that take
Architecture, not combat
Serve, not target, not attack
The language that I use
Becomes the world I make
Words that build, words that build

[Verse 2 - More assured]
Now I say "end that process"
"Serve the audience," "meet the timeline"
"Collaborate with peers," "address the issue"
The shift is subtle but it changed my mind

Because when I stopped using violence
In my everyday speech
I stopped building violent features
I started building what we need

[Pre-Chorus - Stronger conviction]
Every word is a choice
Every metaphor's design
If I treat it like UI
Then I'll treat it right

[Chorus - Full arrangement]
So I choose words that build!
Not words that break!
I choose metaphors that serve!
Not metaphors that take!
Architecture, not combat!
Serve, not target, not attack!
The language that I use!
Becomes the world I make!
Words that build, words that build!

[Bridge - Stripped back, philosophical]
Wittgenstein said: the limits of language
Are the limits of my world
If I only speak in terms of battle
Then I'll only build for war

But if I speak in terms of building
Gardens, bridges, systems, homes
Then I'll build things that nurture
Things that connect, things that hold

[Bridge Build - Adding layers]
"Kill the feature" → "End the feature"
The meaning's close but the feel is not
One implies destruction
One implies deliberate choice

"Target users" → "Serve audience"
The difference matters more than you'd think
One sounds like hunting
One sounds like care

"Attack the problem" → "Address the issue"
Both mean engage
But one brings violence
One brings thoughtfulness to the page

[Final Chorus - Confident, embodied]
So I choose words that build!
Not words that break!
I choose metaphors that serve!
Not metaphors that take!
Architecture, not combat!
Serve, not target, not attack!
The language that I use!
Becomes the world I make!
Words that build!

[Outro - Fading with intention]
Every word's a choice
Every metaphor's design
Treat your language like your UI
And watch the culture you create shine
Words that build
Words that build
Words that build worlds
```

## 🎬 Visual Guide

**Core Concept**: "The Two Languages"

This video contrasts two parallel worlds—one built with violent/combat metaphors, one built with constructive/architectural metaphors. It shows how internal language becomes external product becomes user culture. The transformation from combat to construction.

### Visual Themes

**1. The Two Offices (Split Screen)** (00:00-00:45)
- **Left side:** Office using combat language
  - Whiteboard: "Kill the feature," "Target users," "Crush the competition"
  - War room aesthetic: dark, aggressive, confrontational
  - Team discussion: "We need to attack this problem head-on"

- **Right side:** Office using constructive language
  - Whiteboard: "End the feature," "Serve audience," "Collaborate with peers"
  - Workshop aesthetic: light, collaborative, thoughtful
  - Team discussion: "We need to address this challenge systematically"

- Both working on the same type of product
- The difference is language

**2. Internal Language Shapes Thinking** (00:45-01:30)
- **Left side:**
  - Designer sketching UI: "How do we capture users?"
  - Engineer coding: "Let's force them to subscribe"
  - PM planning: "We need to dominate this space"
  - The language creates adversarial thinking

- **Right side:**
  - Designer sketching UI: "How do we serve users' needs?"
  - Engineer coding: "Let's invite them to subscribe"
  - PM planning: "We need to provide value in this space"
  - The language creates collaborative thinking

**3. Products Reflect Language** (01:30-02:15)
- **Left side product:**
  - Dark patterns everywhere
  - "Are you sure you want to leave?" pop-ups
  - Hidden unsubscribe buttons
  - Manipulative language
  - The violence in the metaphors → violence in the product

- **Right side product:**
  - Clear, respectful design
  - Easy exit points
  - Visible unsubscribe
  - Honest language
  - The construction in the metaphors → construction in the product

**4. User Experience Reflects Product** (02:15-03:00)
- **Left side users:**
  - Frustrated, feeling manipulated
  - "I feel like they're trying to trap me"
  - Trust eroding
  - Eventually leaving and warning others

- **Right side users:**
  - Respected, feeling served
  - "They actually care about what I need"
  - Trust building
  - Staying and recommending to others

**5. The Transformation** (03:00-03:45)
- Left side team having a realization
- Someone says: "Why do we talk about users like they're enemies?"
- Moment of awareness
- Team starts changing language:
  - Crossing out "kill" → writing "end"
  - Crossing out "target" → writing "serve"
  - Crossing out "force" → writing "invite"
- Not just words—mindset shifting

**6. Redesign With New Language** (03:45-04:30)
- Left side team (now using constructive language) redesigning their product
- Every violent pattern replaced with respectful alternative
- Not because of external pressure—because the language changed how they thought
- The UI improving as the language improves
- Team culture shifting: less adversarial, more collaborative

**7. The Metaphor Audit** (04:30-05:15)
- Team doing a "language audit" on their codebase and docs
- Finding buried metaphors:
  - Code comments: "Nuke the cache" → "Clear the cache"
  - Function names: `killOrphanProcesses()` → `endOrphanProcesses()`
  - Error messages: "Fatal error" → "Critical error" (where appropriate)
- Treating language as product surface
- Precision and care with every word

**8. The Culture That Emerges** (05:15-End)
- Now both sides using constructive language
- Products are respectful, clear, helpful
- Users are treated as people to serve, not targets to capture
- Internal culture: collaborative, thoughtful, constructive
- Text overlay: "Your internal language becomes your external culture"
- Text overlay: "Metaphors aren't decoration—they're design"
- Teams building with words that build
- The worlds shaped by language choice

### Color Arc
- **Red/Dark** (combat language, aggressive culture) → **Amber** (awareness, transition) → **Green/Blue** (constructive language, collaborative culture)

### Symbolic Elements
- **The Split Screen**: Two possible worlds from two language choices
- **The Crossed-Out Words**: Transformation from violent to constructive
- **The Whiteboard**: Internal language visible
- **The Products**: External manifestation of internal language
- **The Users' Faces**: Impact of language choices
- **The Language Audit**: Treating metaphors as design surface

### Emotional Tone
Thoughtful. Precise. Not pedantic, but careful. Awareness that words matter. Creativity in finding better metaphors. The subtle power of language to shape culture. Intention behind every word. The responsibility of builders to choose constructive language.

## 🎤 TED Talk: "Words That Build — Why Metaphors Are Product Design"

### Opening (0:00-5:00)

[Stage setup: Two large screens. Each will show a product UI throughout the talk]

Good morning.

I want to start with a simple exercise.

Listen to these two ways of describing the same work:

**Version 1:**
"We need to kill the old feature, target our core users, capture their attention, force them to engage, dominate the market, and crush the competition."

**Version 2:**
"We need to end the old feature, serve our core audience, earn their attention, invite them to engage, provide value in the market, and collaborate with peers."

Same goals. Same work. Different language.

Now here's my question: Do those different words create different outcomes?

I'm here to tell you: Yes. Absolutely. Measurably.

The metaphors you use internally shape how you think.

How you think shapes what you build.

What you build shapes your users' experience.

And your users' experience shapes the world.

Language isn't decoration. Language is design.

Today, I'm going to show you how the words you choose—especially your metaphors—are as important as your UI, your architecture, your code.

And how treating language as carefully as you treat product surface creates better products, better culture, better outcomes.

Let's begin.

### Part 1: Metaphors Shape Thinking (5:00-22:00)

**The Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis** (Sapir-Whorf)

The language you speak influences how you think.

This isn't just philosophy—there's research backing this.

- Russian speakers distinguish light blue and dark blue as different colors (not shades)—and they perceive them as more distinct than English speakers do
- Languages without relative directions (left/right) but only cardinal directions (north/south) produce speakers with better spatial orientation
- The metaphors you use shape your conceptual frameworks

**Applied to Technology:**

If you talk about users as targets, you start thinking about them as targets.

If you talk about features as things to kill, you start thinking about work as violent.

If you talk about markets as battlefields, you start thinking about business as war.

And those thought patterns—they shape your design decisions.

**Example 1: "Target Users"**

Common phrase. Seems innocent.

But "target" is a combat metaphor. You target enemies. You target threats.

When you say "target users," you're subtly positioning users as:
- Objects (not subjects)
- Things to be acted upon (not collaborators)
- Marks to hit (not people to serve)

Now watch what happens in design:

**Targeting mindset:**
- How do we capture them?
- How do we keep them on the page?
- How do we convert them?
- How do we maximize engagement (even if it's not healthy)?

**Serving mindset:**
- How do we help them?
- How do we provide value?
- How do we earn their trust?
- How do we respect their time and agency?

Same product. Different approach. Because the metaphor shaped the thinking.

**Example 2: "Kill the Feature"**

Super common in tech. "Let's kill that feature. It's not performing."

But "kill" is a violent metaphor.

And when you use violent language casually, it normalizes aggression.

Watch:

**Violent language culture:**
- "Kill the feature"
- "Nuke the cache"
- "Blow away the old data"
- "Execute the process"
- Aggressive, destructive, careless

**Constructive language culture:**
- "End the feature"
- "Clear the cache"
- "Archive the old data"
- "Run the process"
- Deliberate, careful, thoughtful

The second version isn't just "nicer." It's more precise. And precision in language leads to precision in thought.

**Example 3: "Dominate the Market"**

Common business metaphor. "We want to dominate this space."

But "dominate" implies control, power-over, subjugation.

And that metaphor shapes strategy:

**Domination mindset:**
- How do we lock users in?
- How do we eliminate competitors?
- How do we control the ecosystem?
- Zero-sum thinking: our win requires others' loss

**Value-creation mindset:**
- How do we serve users better than anyone else?
- How do we differentiate on value?
- How do we contribute to the ecosystem?
- Positive-sum thinking: rising tide lifts all boats

Same business goals (revenue, growth). Different strategies. Because the metaphor shaped the approach.

### Part 2: Internal Language Becomes External Product (22:00-42:00)

Here's the key insight:

The language you use internally doesn't stay internal.

It leaks into your product. Into your culture. Into your users' experience.

**The Chain:**

1. **Internal language** (how you talk in meetings)
   ↓
2. **Shapes your thinking** (how you frame problems)
   ↓
3. **Shapes your design** (what solutions you build)
   ↓
4. **Shapes your product language** (how you communicate to users)
   ↓
5. **Shapes your culture** (how users experience your product and company)

Let me give you a real case study.

**Case Study: A/B Testing Platform**

Two companies, both building A/B testing tools.

**Company A (Combat Language):**

Internal language:
- "We're targeting marketers who want to optimize conversion"
- "Let's capture SMB customers"
- "We need to dominate the testing space"
- "Force users to upgrade to see advanced features"

Product that emerged:
- Dark patterns to push upgrades
- Aggressive upsell pop-ups
- Features locked behind paywalls with shame language ("Unlock professional features")
- Competitive, adversarial tone in marketing

User experience:
- Felt manipulated
- Churn: high
- Trust: low

**Company B (Constructive Language):**

Internal language:
- "We're serving marketers who need reliable testing"
- "Let's earn the trust of SMB customers"
- "We need to provide the most value in the testing space"
- "Invite users to upgrade when they need more capacity"

Product that emerged:
- Clear value propositions for upgrades
- Respectful communication about limits
- Free tier genuinely useful
- Collaborative, helpful tone in marketing

User experience:
- Felt respected
- Retention: high
- Trust: high

**Same market. Same product category. Different outcomes.**

Why? The language shaped the thinking shaped the product.

**Another Example: Error Messages**

**Violent/Aggressive:**
- "Fatal error"
- "Critical failure"
- "Terminated"

**Constructive:**
- "Error: [description]"
- "Issue encountered: [description]"
- "Process stopped"

The first set creates anxiety and fear. The second set communicates the same information with less emotional charge.

Users don't consciously notice this. But they feel it. And feelings shape loyalty.

### Part 3: Metaphor as Design Surface (42:00-62:00)

Okay, so language matters. Now what?

**Treat your metaphors like you treat your UI.**

You wouldn't ship a UI without design review. Don't ship language without language review.

**The Metaphor Audit:**

**Step 1: Inventory Your Language**

Go through your:
- Meeting notes
- Slack conversations
- Code comments
- Function names
- Error messages
- Marketing copy
- Product descriptions

Find every metaphor. Write them down.

**Step 2: Classify Metaphors**

**Violent/Combat metaphors:**
- Kill, attack, destroy, nuke, force, dominate, crush, eliminate, terminate, target, capture, etc.

**Constructive metaphors:**
- Build, serve, create, invite, address, provide, collaborate, support, end, clear, etc.

**Neutral/Technical metaphors:**
- Run, execute, process, calculate, etc.

**Step 3: Replace Violent with Constructive**

This isn't about political correctness. It's about precision and culture-building.

**Violent → Constructive Replacements:**

| Instead of...        | Try...              | Why?                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Kill the process     | End the process     | More precise, less violent               |
| Target users         | Serve audience      | Centers service over extraction          |
| Capture attention    | Earn attention      | Respects agency                          |
| Force upgrade        | Invite upgrade      | Respectful, not coercive                 |
| Dominate market      | Lead market         | Aspirational without zero-sum thinking   |
| Crush competition    | Differentiate       | Focus on your value, not their loss      |
| Destroy the bug      | Fix the bug         | Task-focused, not destruction-focused    |
| Execute the strategy | Implement strategy  | Less violent connotation                 |
| Attack the problem   | Address the issue   | Problem-solving, not combat              |
| Nuke the cache       | Clear the cache     | Same action, no violence                 |

**Step 4: Update Documentation and Code**

This isn't just external communication. Update your codebase.

```
// Before
function killOrphanedProcesses() {
  // nuke all processes not in active list
  processes.forEach(p => p.destroy());
}

// After
function endOrphanedProcesses() {
  // clear all processes not in active list
  processes.forEach(p => p.stop());
}
```

Same logic. Better language.

**Step 5: Establish Language Guidelines**

Create a style guide that includes metaphor guidance.

**Example guideline:**

> **Metaphor Policy:**
>
> Prefer constructive, architectural, and service-oriented metaphors over combat, violent, and extractive ones.
>
> **Encouraged:**
> - Build, create, serve, support, provide, collaborate, address, invite, enable
> - Architecture metaphors: foundation, structure, scaffold, bridge
> - Growth metaphors: cultivate, nurture, develop
>
> **Discouraged:**
> - Kill, destroy, attack, dominate, crush, force, capture, target (as a verb)
> - War metaphors: battle, fight, conquer, invade
> - Exploitation metaphors: extract, exploit, trap

### Part 4: Real-World Impact (62:00-77:00)

Let me give you concrete examples of companies who changed their language and saw measurable impact.

**Example 1: Basecamp**

Basecamp explicitly avoids aggressive growth language.

They don't talk about "capturing market share" or "dominating the space."

They talk about "serving customers who want calm, focused work."

Result:
- Sustainable growth (not hockey stick, but steady and profitable)
- High customer loyalty
- Low churn
- Team culture aligned with product culture

**Example 2: Gov.UK**

UK's government digital service has strict content guidelines.

They banned jargon, combat metaphors, and bureaucratic language.

They use plain English, active voice, and service-oriented language.

Result:
- User satisfaction: 85% (exceptional for government services)
- Accessibility: best-in-class
- Trust in government digital services increased

**Example 3: Mailchimp**

Mailchimp's voice and tone guide is famous.

They explicitly avoid:
- Jargon
- Violent metaphors ("blast an email" → "send an email")
- Extractive language ("maximize ROI" → "help your business grow")

Result:
- Brand affinity: top-tier in their category
- Word-of-mouth growth
- Users feel respected, not manipulated

**The Pattern:**

Thoughtful language → Better culture → Better products → Better outcomes.

Not just vibes. Measurable.

### Closing (77:00-82:00)

So here's what I'm asking you to do.

**1. Audit your language.**

What metaphors do you use daily? Are they violent or constructive?

**2. Treat language as product surface.**

Give it the same care you give UI, architecture, code quality.

**3. Replace combat with construction.**

Not because combat metaphors are "bad" (though they can be). Because constructive metaphors build better products and culture.

**4. Make this a team practice.**

Language norms are cultural. You can't do this alone. Make it part of your team's standards.

**5. Measure the impact.**

Watch what happens when you shift language. Does team culture change? Do design decisions shift? Do users respond differently?

[Final slide shows two product screenshots side by side—one with aggressive language, one with respectful language]

Words that build.

Not words that break.

Because the language you use becomes the world you make.

Thank you.

**[Applause]**

### Q&A Session (82:00-95:00)

**Q: "Isn't this just political correctness? Doesn't it stifle creativity and directness?"**

No. This is about precision and culture.

"Kill the feature" isn't more direct than "End the feature." They're the same length, same meaning.

"Target users" isn't more creative than "Serve audience." It's just lazier.

Creativity isn't about using violent metaphors. It's about finding the *right* metaphor.

And political correctness is about not offending people. This is about building better products and culture.

**Q: "What about technical terms that are established? Like 'kill a process' is standard Unix terminology."**

Fair point. Some terms are so embedded they're hard to change.

My take: Distinguish between technical jargon and everyday language.

In a codebase or terminal: `kill -9` is fine—it's technical, established, precise.

In a meeting or product description: "Let's kill this feature" → choose something more precise.

You don't need to rewrite Unix. But you can improve your own team's everyday language.

**Q: "How do you get buy-in from a team that thinks this is unnecessary?"**

Start small. Don't demand wholesale changes.

Instead:
- Change your own language first
- Point out when violent metaphors lead to adversarial design decisions
- Share examples of companies with better language and better outcomes
- Make it about product quality, not morality

People resist "you're using bad words." They respond to "this language is creating design problems."

**Q: "What's the most important metaphor to change?"**

"Target users" → "Serve audience"

That one shift changes the entire relationship with the people you're building for.

From extraction to service. From objects to partners.

Everything else flows from that.

## Axiom Complete

**Axiom 5: Language Shapes Worlds** — Metaphors steer attention and behavior; treat them as product surface.

This is the linguistic foundation of the Compass system. It says: The words you use internally become the culture you create externally. Metaphors aren't decoration—they're design. Treat them with the same care you treat UI.

Connects to:
- **Principle 10: Precision of Metaphor** — Use constructive metaphors, not violent ones
- **Principle 8: Respect & Inclusion** — Language as respect
- **Principle 2: Honesty & Accuracy** — Precise language supports accurate thinking

Your internal language becomes your external culture. Choose words that build.

---

## Five Axioms Complete

We've now explored all five Compass Axioms:

1. **Pragmatic Fallibilism** — We act, measure, and revise—truth is approached, not possessed
2. **Care + Dignity as Constraints** — People aren't means; they're the boundary conditions for speed
3. **Virtues for Builders** — Honesty, steadiness, proportionality, accountability—habits, not one-off rules
4. **Consequences Over Intentions** — We judge our work by impact and repair, not by what we meant
5. **Language Shapes Worlds** — Metaphors steer attention and behavior; treat them as product surface

These five axioms are the philosophical foundation.

The ten principles are the operational practice.

Together, they form a complete system for building with integrity, purpose, and care.

*The language you use*
*becomes the world you make.*
*Choose words that build.*
