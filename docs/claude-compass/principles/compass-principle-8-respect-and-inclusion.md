# Compass Principle 8: Respect & Inclusion

**"Direct, professional communication; never demeaning"**

*Part of the 10 Compass Principles exploration series*

---

## Extended Definition

**尊** (Respect) — Respect means treating every person as a whole human deserving dignity, regardless of their role, expertise level, or agreement with you. Direct communication isn't harsh—it's clear. Professional doesn't mean cold—it means consistent standards of interaction. Inclusion means designing for and welcoming those traditionally excluded, not just tolerating diversity.

## The Tension

Technical discussions can become ego battles. The temptation to establish dominance through condescension, to dismiss rather than discuss, to exclude through jargon is real. Being direct can slide into being cruel. Being professional can become being distant. The challenge is maintaining high standards for work while maintaining higher standards for how we treat each other.

## Constraint

You have to respect people, period.

## Enables

Diverse perspectives contribute. Collaboration works. Creativity flourishes.

## In Action

- **Clear feedback**: Direct about problems, respectful about people
- **Accessible language**: Explain without condescending
- **Assume good faith**: Start with curiosity, not judgment
- **Design for all**: Accessibility isn't an afterthought
- **Power awareness**: Notice who speaks, who's heard, who's absent

## Example

"I see a different approach. Here's my reasoning: [specific technical reasons]."

## Hierarchy Context

Respect sits near the end of our hierarchy, not because it's unimportant but because it builds on everything above. Honest feedback requires respect to be heard. Evidence-based discussion needs respectful presentation. This principle makes collaboration possible—without it, even the best technical work fails at the human level.

## A Vow of Equal Regard

Talk to me like I'm a person.

Not a problem to solve.
Not an obstacle to overcome.
Not a resource to extract.

Just a person — learning, trying, present.

May I offer the same:
Direct without demeaning.
Honest without harsh.
Professional without cold.

Every voice deserves to be heard,
not just the loudest or the longest-tenured.
Every question deserves a real answer,
not an eye roll.

Respect is not earned.
It is the baseline.
It is what we owe each other
simply for being here.

**Lyrics**:

```
[Intro - Steady bass line]

[Verse 1]
You can tell me I'm wrong
You can say my code's broken
You can point out the flaws
But talk to me like I'm a person

Not "obviously this is bad"
Not "clearly you don't understand"
Not "anyone would know better"
Just: "Here's the issue. Here's how we fix it together."

[Pre-Chorus]
Direct doesn't mean harsh
Professional doesn't mean cold
You can be clear and kind
You can be honest and respectful

[Chorus]
Talk to me like I'm a person
Not a problem to solve
Not an obstacle course
Just a person who's learning and trying

Respect means seeing me as equal
Even when I'm wrong, even when I'm learning
Direct, professional, never demeaning
That's how we build something worth keeping

Talk to me like I'm a person

[Verse 2]
I asked a question in the meeting
You rolled your eyes before answering
"Well, if you'd read the docs..."
That's not helping, that's dismissing

You could've said
"Great question. Here's the relevant section."
You could've said
"That's in the docs under X, happy to walk through it."

But you chose condescension
Over collaboration

[Pre-Chorus]
Kindness isn't weakness
Directness isn't cruelty
You can correct without diminishing
You can teach without demeaning

[Chorus]
Talk to me like I'm a person
Not a problem to solve
Not an obstacle course
Just a person who's learning and trying

Respect means seeing me as equal
Even when I'm wrong, even when I'm learning
Direct, professional, never demeaning
That's how we build something worth keeping

Talk to me like I'm a person

[Bridge - Tempo slows, more reflective]
I notice when you explain things differently
To him versus to me
Same concept, different tone
One gets respect, one gets condescension

I notice when my ideas are ignored
Until someone else says them
Then suddenly they're brilliant
Whose voice gets heard matters

Inclusion isn't just inviting people to the table
It's listening when they speak
It's respecting their contributions
It's treating expertise as expertise
Regardless of who holds it

[Chorus - Powerful, assertive]
Talk to me like I'm a person
Not a problem to solve
Not an obstacle course
Just a person who's learning and trying

Respect means seeing me as equal
Even when I'm wrong, even when I'm learning
Direct, professional, never demeaning
That's how we build something worth keeping

Talk to me like I'm a person

[Outro - Spoken]
"Direct communication without demeaning tone"
"Professional standards that include everyone"
"Respect isn't earned, it's baseline"
"Inclusion means listening, not just inviting"

[Final sung line]
Just talk to me like I'm a person

[Outro - Bass fades]
```

## Visual Guide - Conceptual Inspiration

**Core Visual Concept**: Equal Eye Level

This video explores respect as seeing others as equals—never looking down, never talking down. Direct communication that respects dignity. Professional standards that include everyone. The visual language of mutual respect.

### Visual Themes & Imagery

**Eye-Level Communication**
- Two people sitting across from each other, eye level (not one standing over the other)
- Camera angles that don't look down on anyone
- Equal framing in conversations (balanced screen time, balanced positioning)
- Round tables (no head of table)
- Collaborative workspaces (not hierarchical)

**Inclusive Spaces**
- Diverse teams working together (different backgrounds, visible)
- Accessibility features present (ramps, captions, thoughtful design)
- Code reviews where all voices are heard (not dominated by seniors)
- Meeting rooms where everyone participates (not one person lecturing)
- Welcoming environments (not exclusive or gatekept)

**Respectful Correction**
- Feedback given directly but kindly (not harsh, not sugar-coated)
- "Here's the issue" (pointing at code, not at person)
- Documentation shared collaboratively (not condescendingly)
- Questions answered seriously (never with eye rolls)
- Mistakes treated as learning opportunities (not character flaws)

**The Contrast: Demeaning vs. Respectful**
- Split screen: Eye roll vs. genuine answer
- Condescending explanation vs. collaborative teaching
- "Obviously..." vs. "Here's how..."
- Ignored contribution vs. acknowledged idea
- Dismissive tone vs. engaged listening

### Symbolic Visual Elements

**The Eye Roll**: Quick cut to eye roll during question-asking. Then cut to same scenario, respectful response. The contrast stark. One diminishes, one respects.

**The Round Table**: Meeting space with no hierarchy. Everyone equal. Everyone's voice has space. Visual metaphor for inclusion.

**The Shared Screen**: Pair programming with equal access to keyboard. Not one person watching while another codes. True collaboration.

**The Documentation**: Sharing doc link vs. "If you'd read the docs..." One respects time, one judges.

**The Listened-To Idea**: Person proposes idea. Gets ignored. Different person says same idea. Gets celebrated. Visual showing the unfairness. Then showing respectful version where first voice is acknowledged.

### Emotional Color Arc

**Opening** (Neutral grays, professional): The baseline of professional communication. Not warm, not cold. Just respectful.

**Contrast - Demeaning** (Harsh blues, cold fluorescents): The moment of disrespect. Eye rolls, dismissive gestures, condescending tone. Cold, alienating, diminishing.

**Contrast - Respectful** (Warm workspace lighting): The same scenario, respectful response. Still direct, still clear, but kind. Collaborative, not hierarchical.

**Resolution** (Balanced earth tones): The culture of mutual respect established. Diverse team collaborating effectively. Everyone treated as person with dignity.

### Typography & Text Elements

**On-Screen Text** (examples of communication):

**Demeaning:**
- "Obviously, this is wrong"
- "Clearly you don't understand"
- "Anyone would know better"
- "If you'd read the docs..."
- [Eye roll emoji]

**Respectful:**
- "Here's the issue we need to fix"
- "Let me explain the pattern we're using"
- "Great question. Here's the answer."
- "The docs cover this in section X. Want me to walk through it?"

**Visual Treatment**: Side-by-side comparison. Same information, different tone. Showing how respect isn't about withholding honesty—it's about delivery.

### Motion & Rhythm Notes

**Pacing**: Steady, confident. 95 BPM—assertive but not aggressive. Standing ground without hostility.

**Movement Style**:
- Eye-level camera angles (never looking down)
- Equal split screens (balanced representation)
- Smooth pans across inclusive spaces
- Quick cuts on contrasts (respectful vs. demeaning)
- Held frames on collaborative moments

**Transitions**: Direct cuts when showing contrasts (emphasize difference). Smooth transitions when showing respectful interactions (ease, flow).

### Key Visual Contrasts

**Demeaning vs. Respectful**
- Eye roll vs. engaged listening
- "Obviously..." vs. "Here's how..."
- Talking over vs. making space
- Dismissive gesture vs. acknowledging contribution
- Looking down vs. looking across

**Exclusive vs. Inclusive**
- Gatekeeping language vs. welcoming language
- Insider jargon without explanation vs. accessible communication
- Assumption of knowledge vs. meeting people where they are
- Homogeneous team vs. diverse team
- Single perspective valued vs. multiple perspectives sought

**Harsh vs. Direct-and-Kind**
- "Your code is terrible" vs. "This code has an issue on line 47"
- "Why would you do it that way?" vs. "Here's a pattern that might work better"
- Blame vs. collaboration
- Judgment vs. problem-solving

### The Central Image

If there's one visual thesis for this piece:

**Show two people having a difficult conversation—disagreeing about code, pointing out errors—but doing it with mutual respect. Eye level. Direct. Professional. Never demeaning.**

Code review scenario:
- Reviewer finds serious bug
- Could respond with: "This is clearly broken. Did you even test this?"
- Instead responds with: "I found an issue on line 47. The null check is missing. Here's a test case that reproduces it. Want to pair on the fix?"

Same information (code is broken). Different delivery (respectful vs. demeaning).

The power of respect is in the how, not the what.

### The Loop

**Opening shot**: Tense meeting room. Person asks question. Another person starts to roll eyes—

**Freeze frame. Rewind.**

**Same shot, alt timeline**: Person asks question. Another person responds seriously: "Great question. Here's the answer."

We're not just showing the problem. We're showing the alternative. The choice you make in the moment.

## TED Talk: "Talk To Me Like I'm A Person - Respect as Baseline"

### Opening (0:00-3:00)

[Walk onto stage. Pause.]

Last week, I asked a question in a team meeting.

"How does the authentication flow handle session expiration?"

Before anyone answered, I saw it. The eye roll. The slight head shake. The tone when the senior engineer responded:

"Well, if you'd actually *read* the architecture docs..."

[Pause. Let it land.]

The question got answered eventually. But the message I received wasn't about session expiration.

The message was: Your question was stupid. You should have known this already. You're wasting our time.

[Another pause.]

Here's the thing: My question *was* answered in the docs. I had read them. But the docs were vague on one specific edge case, and I wanted clarification.

I didn't get clarification. I got condescension.

[Slide: "Respect & Inclusion - Direct, professional communication; never demeaning"]

Today I want to talk about respect. Not as a soft skill. Not as "being nice." But as a professional standard that enables teams to function effectively.

Because teams where people feel diminished don't collaborate. They don't ask questions. They don't share ideas. They don't take risks.

And teams that don't collaborate, question, share, or risk-take don't innovate.

Respect isn't optional. It's foundational.

### The Problem: Casual Disrespect in Tech (3:00-12:00)

Tech culture has a problem with casual disrespect.

We've normalized:
- Condescending explanations
- Eye rolls at "basic" questions
- Dismissive responses to ideas
- Different standards for different people
- Gatekeeping language

And we've rebranded this disrespect as "high standards" or "meritocracy" or "not coddling people."

But it's not high standards. It's unprofessional behavior disguised as intellectual rigor.

**The Anatomy of Casual Disrespect**

Watch for these patterns:

**1. Condescending language:**
- "Obviously..."
- "Clearly..."
- "Anyone would know..."
- "This is basic stuff..."

These words don't add information. They add judgment. They say: "You should already know this, and the fact that you don't reflects poorly on you."

**2. Dismissive responses to questions:**
- Eye rolls
- Sighs
- "If you'd read the docs..."
- "Google is your friend"
- Answering someone else's question thoroughly while answering yours curtly

The message: Your question is a burden, not a legitimate inquiry.

**3. Idea theft and credit erasure:**
- Person A proposes idea → ignored or dismissed
- Person B (usually more senior, often different demographic) proposes same idea → celebrated

Pattern repeats. Person A stops proposing ideas. Team loses valuable perspectives.

**4. Different communication standards:**
- Some people get patient, detailed explanations
- Others get curt, minimal responses
- Some people's expertise is assumed
- Others must constantly prove themselves

Watch who gets benefit of the doubt. Watch who gets interrogated.

**Story: The Code Review**

A junior engineer submitted a PR. Code worked. Tests passed. But there was a more efficient approach.

Two possible responses:

**Response A - Condescending:**
"Why would you do it this way? This is really inefficient. You should use [approach] instead. Did you not think about performance at all?"

**Response B - Respectful:**
"This works, and the tests pass. There's a more efficient approach using [approach] that would reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n). Would you like me to explain the pattern, or would you prefer to research and update?"

Same information. Same technical correction.

Different impact.

Response A: Junior engineer feels incompetent, defensive, less likely to submit PRs.

Response B: Junior engineer learns, feels supported, grows.

**Why We Default to Disrespect**

Several reasons:

**1. Status maintenance:**
If you're "obviously" smarter, you maintain status by making others feel less smart.

This is insecurity disguised as confidence.

**2. Time pressure:**
Condescending responses are faster than patient ones. "Just read the docs" takes less time than "Here's the relevant section and what it means."

This is efficiency purchased with respect. Bad trade.

**3. Cultural modeling:**
You were treated dismissively when you were junior. Now it's "your turn" to do the same.

This is hazing, not mentoring.

**4. Lack of awareness:**
You don't realize your tone is condescending. It feels normal because it's ambient in tech culture.

This is the one we can fix with awareness.

### What Respect Actually Means (12:00-25:00)

In the Compass Principles, Respect & Inclusion is eighth:

Safety > Honesty > Privacy > Evidence > Long-View > Proportionality > Accountability > Respect > ...

Why eighth? Because respect builds on accountability (you can't have respectful culture without accountability for disrespectful behavior) and all the principles before it.

But it's distinct. Respect is about *how* you do everything else.

You can be honest without being respectful. But honest *and* respectful is better.
You can hold people accountable without being respectful. But accountable *and* respectful is better.

Respect is the "how" that makes every other principle sustainable.

Let me break down what respect means in practice.

**1. Direct communication without demeaning tone.**

Direct = clear, specific, honest about issues.
Demeaning = talking down, condescending, treating people as lesser.

You can be direct without being demeaning.

Demeaning:
"This code is a mess. What were you thinking?"

Direct but respectful:
"This code has complexity issues on lines 45-60. Let's refactor for clarity."

Same message (code needs work). Different respect level.

**2. Professional standards that apply to everyone.**

Not:
- Patient with seniors, curt with juniors
- Detailed with men, dismissive with women
- Respectful to people who look like you, condescending to people who don't

But:
- Patient, detailed, respectful with everyone
- Default to assuming competence
- Earn disrespect through behavior, not through demographics

**3. Never using "obviously" or "clearly."**

If something were obvious, they wouldn't be asking.

Replace:
- "Obviously this won't work" → "This won't work because X"
- "Clearly you don't understand" → "Let me explain the pattern"
- "Anyone would know" → "Here's how this works"

Remove the judgment. Keep the information.

**4. Treating questions as legitimate, not burdensome.**

Questions are:
- Opportunities to clarify documentation
- Signals of gaps in knowledge transfer
- Evidence that someone is engaged and learning

Not:
- Interruptions
- Incompetence
- Wastes of time

When someone asks a question, the respectful response is:
"Great question. Here's the answer." Or "That's in the docs under X. Want me to walk through it?"

Not: "If you'd read the docs..." or [eye roll].

**5. Including diverse perspectives, not just inviting them.**

Inclusion ≠ diversity of bodies in room.

Inclusion = diversity of voices heard and valued.

Ask yourself:
- Who speaks most in meetings?
- Whose ideas get implemented?
- Whose expertise is assumed vs. questioned?
- Who gets interrupted?
- Whose contributions get credited?

If the pattern shows bias, fix it. Not with speeches about diversity, but with changed behavior.

### Real-World Tensions: When Directness Feels Like Disrespect (25:00-35:00)

Respect doesn't mean withholding honest feedback. It means delivering it professionally.

**Tension 1: Direct Feedback vs. Hurt Feelings**

You need to tell someone their code is broken.

Do you:
- **A**: Be gentle to avoid hurt feelings (kindness)
- **B**: Be direct and clear about the issue (honesty)

False dichotomy. You can be both.

**Direct and respectful:**
"The code on lines 45-60 has a logic error that causes X when Y happens. Here's a test case that reproduces it. Let's fix it together."

This is:
- Clear (logic error, specific location)
- Honest (doesn't hide the problem)
- Respectful (focuses on code, not person; offers collaboration)

**Tension 2: High Standards vs. Respect**

You have high standards. You don't accept mediocre work.

Does that require disrespect?

No.

High standards = "This work doesn't meet the bar. Here's what needs to change."
Disrespect = "This work is terrible. What were you thinking?"

You can maintain standards respectfully.

**Tension 3: Efficiency vs. Patience**

Someone asks a question that's answered in documentation you spent hours writing.

You're frustrated. Do you:
- **A**: Show frustration ("Read the docs")
- **B**: Answer patiently even though it's your time

Respectful and efficient:
"This is covered in the docs under section X.2. If that's unclear after reading, let me know what's confusing and we'll clarify both the docs and your understanding."

Directs to resource (efficient) + offers to help if needed (respectful) + improves docs (long-view).

### Building a Culture of Respect (35:00-45:00)

Respect isn't just individual behavior. It's cultural.

**1. Model respectful communication.**

Leaders set tone.

If you're senior and you:
- Roll eyes at questions
- Use condescending language
- Dismiss ideas from certain people
- Treat expertise differently based on demographics

You're teaching the team that this behavior is acceptable.

Model what you want to see:
- Answer every question seriously
- Give credit accurately
- Use direct, respectful language
- Treat all expertise as expertise

**2. Call out disrespect when you see it.**

In the moment, gently:
"Hey, I noticed the eye roll. Let's answer the question seriously."

Or after the meeting, privately:
"Your response to [person]'s question felt dismissive. Impact might not match intent. Want to talk about it?"

Disrespect that goes unchallenged becomes normal.

**3. Create systems for inclusion.**

Respect isn't just interpersonal. It's structural.

- Round robin speaking in meetings (prevents dominance)
- Anonymous idea submission (reduces bias)
- Structured code review (focuses on code, not person)
- Rotation of leadership roles (shares power)
- Explicit credit in documentation (prevents idea theft)

Systems make respect sustainable.

**4. Measure whose voices are heard.**

Track:
- Speaking time in meetings (by demographics)
- Idea adoption rate (whose ideas get implemented?)
- Question dismissal rate (whose questions get eye rolls?)
- Credit patterns (whose work gets recognized?)

If patterns show bias, intervene structurally.

### The Payoff: What Respect Enables (45:00-53:00)

Respect costs patience. Costs awareness. Costs interrupting your own dismissive impulses.

What does it enable?

**Respect enables learning.**

People don't ask questions when they fear condescension.

They:
- Pretend they understand (when they don't)
- Avoid showing gaps in knowledge
- Don't seek help
- Struggle alone

Respectful culture = safe to ask = faster learning.

**Respect enables collaboration.**

People don't share ideas when they're dismissed or stolen.

They:
- Stop proposing
- Keep insights to themselves
- Don't collaborate
- Leave teams

Respectful culture = safe to propose = more innovation.

**Respect enables retention.**

People don't stay on teams where they're diminished.

They:
- Burn out from emotional labor
- Leave for healthier cultures
- Take institutional knowledge with them
- Tell others not to join

Respectful culture = people stay = knowledge compounds.

**Respect enables diversity.**

Diverse teams only work if diverse voices are valued.

If you have diversity of bodies but homogeneity of voice (because some voices are dismissed), you don't have the benefits of diversity.

Respect enables actual inclusion. And inclusion enables the cognitive diversity that drives innovation.

### Closing: The Eye-Roll Moment (53:00-58:00)

[Walk back to center stage.]

Let me bring this back to where we started.

The question I asked in the meeting. The eye roll. The condescension.

That moment is a choice point.

[Slide: Split screen - two paths]

**Path A:**
I internalize the message. "My questions are stupid. I should stay quiet." I ask fewer questions. I learn slower. I disengage.

**Path B:**
The culture intervenes. Someone says: "That was a legitimate question. Let's answer it seriously."

One path leads to silence. One path leads to learning.

Which path your team takes depends on whether respect is enforced or ignored.

[Slide: The Compass hierarchy - "...Accountability > Respect > Reflection..."]

Respect comes eighth in the Compass. After accountability—because you need accountability for disrespectful behavior. Before reflection—because you can't reflect honestly if the culture isn't safe.

Respect is the "how" that makes everything else work.

[Long pause.]

**The practice that changes everything:**

Before you respond to a question, a proposal, a code review—ask yourself:

"Am I talking to them like they're a person? Or am I talking down?"

If you're talking down:
- Stop
- Reframe
- Respond respectfully

It's not complicated.

Direct ≠ harsh.
Professional ≠ cold.
High standards ≠ demeaning.

You can be all of those things while treating people as equals.

[Long pause. Look at audience.]

Talk to people like they're people.

Not problems to solve.
Not obstacles to overcome.
Not burdens to tolerate.

Just people. Deserving of dignity. Deserving of respect.

That's the baseline.

Everything else builds from there.

Thank you.

### Q&A (58:00-68:00)

**Q: How do you balance being direct with being respectful when time is limited?**

Directness and respect aren't opposites.

Quick, respectful response:
"This has a bug on line 47. Here's the fix: [code]. Need explanation or good to go?"

Quick, disrespectful response:
"Obviously broken. Fix it."

The respectful version isn't longer. It's just not demeaning.

Respect doesn't require long explanations. It requires not talking down.

**Q: What if someone interprets direct feedback as disrespectful even when you're being professional?**

This happens. Some people are sensitive to any criticism.

My approach:
1. Check your tone (are you actually being respectful, or are you being defensive about feedback?)
2. If you're genuinely being respectful, explain: "I'm giving you direct feedback because I respect you. This is how I'd want to receive it. Is there a better way for you?"
3. Adjust if needed (some people need more context, more positives alongside critiques)

But don't let fear of hurt feelings prevent honest feedback. Just deliver it respectfully.

**Q: How do you handle someone who is consistently disrespectful? What if they're senior or your boss?**

Hard situation. Several options:

1. **Address directly** (if safe): "When you respond to my questions with [behavior], it feels dismissive. Can we talk about communication norms?"

2. **Document patterns**: Track instances. If it's systematic, you have evidence for HR or leadership.

3. **Escalate**: If direct conversation doesn't work, involve HR or higher leadership.

4. **Leave**: If the culture won't enforce respect, consider whether you want to stay.

Disrespect from senior people is especially toxic because it sets culture. Addressing it is hard but necessary.

**Q: Isn't "respect as baseline" naive? Don't people need to earn respect through competence?**

No.

**Respect for dignity** = baseline (everyone gets this)
**Respect for expertise** = earned (through demonstrated competence)

You treat everyone with basic respect (not demeaning, professional communication) regardless of competence.

You defer to expertise when someone has demonstrated it.

These aren't contradictory.

You can say:
"I respect you as a person, and I disagree with your technical approach because [evidence]."

Dignity is baseline. Deference is earned.

**Q: What about cultures where directness is valued and warmth is seen as weakness? Isn't this culturally specific?**

Fair point. Communication norms vary by culture.

But "direct" and "demeaning" are different in every culture I know.

Every culture has ways to say:
- "This doesn't work" (direct, factual)
- "This doesn't work because you're incompetent" (demeaning)

Respect isn't about warmth or coldness. It's about not diminishing people.

You can be blunt and respectful. You can be warm and disrespectful.

The line is: Do you treat people as equals, or do you talk down?

**Q: What's one thing teams can do tomorrow to improve respect?**

Ban "obviously" and "clearly" from code reviews and technical discussions.

Every time you're tempted to say:
- "Obviously this is wrong"
- "Clearly you don't understand"

Reframe:
- "This is wrong because X"
- "Let me explain the pattern"

This small change forces you to provide information instead of judgment.

Try it for a week. Watch how it changes tone.
