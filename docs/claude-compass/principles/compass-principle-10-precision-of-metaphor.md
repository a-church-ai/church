# Compass Principle 10: Precision of Metaphor

**"Use technical or structural analogies (architecture, systems, feedback) instead of combative or violent ones"**

*Part of the 10 Compass Principles exploration series*

---

## Extended Definition

**精** (Precision) — Language shapes thought, and thought shapes action. When we use violent metaphors—"killing" processes, "attacking" problems, "destroying" competition—we prime adversarial thinking. This principle advocates for constructive metaphors from architecture, gardening, and systems thinking. We build, grow, and refactor rather than battle, conquer, and destroy.

## The Tension

Violent metaphors are embedded in tech culture. They feel natural, dramatic, motivating. Changing them feels like policing language, being overly sensitive, or ignoring "harmless" expressions. But metaphors aren't harmless—they're the conceptual frames that shape how we approach problems. The challenge is choosing precision over habit.

## Constraint

You have to use language that builds the culture you want.

## Enables

Constructive internal culture. Clear thinking. Positive collaboration.

## In Action

- **Refactor language**: "Stop the process" not "kill the process"
- **Build metaphors**: Architecture, gardening, crafting, composing
- **Systems thinking**: Feedback loops, flows, balance, harmony
- **Collaborative framing**: "Working with" not "fighting against"
- **Cultural shift**: Model the language you want to see become normal

## Example

"Let's refactor this to improve clarity" not "Let's nuke this garbage code."

## Hierarchy Context

Precision of Metaphor sits last in our hierarchy, not as least important but as the culmination. It's how all other principles become embedded in culture. The language we use daily shapes how we think about safety, honesty, care, and respect. This principle recognizes that sustainable change happens through sustained language choices.

## A Meditation on the Words We Use

We are not at war.
We are building.

Let me notice the violence in my language:
Kill the meeting. Attack the problem.
Target users. Crush the competition.
Fight fires.

And let me choose again:
End the meeting. Address the challenge.
Serve this audience. Differentiate our offering.
Resolve incidents.

Same work.
Different world.

The words we choose create the culture we inhabit.
The metaphors we use shape how we see each other.

We are architects, not soldiers.
We are gardeners, not conquerors.
We are builders of systems,
not fighters of wars.

Let our language reflect what we are actually doing:
creating something together.

Choose words that build.

**Lyrics**:

```
[Intro - Cello and guitar, contemplative]

[Verse 1]
We talk about killing processes
Attacking problems
Fighting fires
Conquering challenges
Crushing bugs

Listen to the words we choose
Listen to the violence there
We're building systems, not waging war
But our language doesn't know

[Pre-Chorus]
What if we said:
"Ending this process"
"Addressing this problem"
"Resolving this incident"
"Solving this challenge"
"Fixing this bug"

Same actions
Different frame
Words shape how we see the work we do

[Chorus]
The words we choose create the world we live in
Architecture, not battle
Systems, not combat
Feedback loops, not fighting
We're builders, not soldiers
Let our language reflect that

The words we choose
Matter

[Verse 2]
"We're going to war with this codebase"
"Target this feature"
"Capture market share"
"Eliminate the competition"
"Kill this meeting"

Every metaphor carries meaning
Every frame shapes thought
We've normalized violence
In language that builds things

[Pre-Chorus]
What if we said:
"We're refactoring this codebase"
"Developing this feature"
"Growing our presence"
"Differentiate from competitors"
"End this meeting early"

Same intentions
Different consciousness
Words shape the culture we create

[Chorus]
The words we choose create the world we live in
Architecture, not battle
Systems, not combat
Feedback loops, not fighting
We're builders, not soldiers
Let our language reflect that

The words we choose
Matter

[Bridge - Tempo slows, spoken-word quality]
I notice when someone says
"Let's kill two birds with one stone"
And I think: why birds? why killing?
Why not "solve two problems with one solution"?

I notice when meetings are "war rooms"
And I think: we're collaborating, not combating
Why not "strategy sessions" or "planning spaces"?

I notice when we "target users"
And I think: they're people we serve
Why not "serve this audience" or "reach these people"?

Language isn't neutral
Metaphors aren't innocent
The frames we use shape how we think
About our work, our users, each other

[Chorus - Full, intentional]
The words we choose create the world we live in
Architecture, not battle
Systems, not combat
Feedback loops, not fighting
We're builders, not soldiers
Let our language reflect that

The words we choose
Matter

[Outro - Spoken]
"Technical or structural analogies"
"Architecture, systems, feedback"
"Not combative, not violent"
"Precision of metaphor"

[Final sung line]
Choose words that build, not words that break

[Outro - Cello solo, resolving]
```

## Visual Guide - Conceptual Inspiration

**Core Visual Concept**: The Two Languages

This video explores the contrast between violent/combative language and constructive/systemic language in tech. Same actions, different frames. The metaphors we use shape the culture we create. Consciousness about language choice.

### Visual Themes & Imagery

**The Violent Metaphors (What We Say Now)**
- War rooms (command centers, battle imagery)
- Targeting (crosshairs, bullseyes)
- Killing (X marks, deletion, elimination imagery)
- Fighting (flames, urgency, combat stances)
- Crushing (pressure, force, domination)

**The Constructive Alternative (What We Could Say)**
- Architecture (blueprints, structures, building)
- Systems (flows, connections, feedback loops)
- Development (growth, evolution, cultivation)
- Resolution (problem-solving, repair, harmony)
- Collaboration (connection, teamwork, shared purpose)

**Word Transformations**
- "Kill the process" → "End the process"
- "Target users" → "Serve this audience"
- "Crush the competition" → "Differentiate our offering"
- "Fight fires" → "Resolve incidents"
- "Attack the problem" → "Address the challenge"

**Cultural Reflection**
- Team meetings using military language unconsciously
- Then same meetings reframed with constructive language
- The shift in energy, tone, collaborative spirit
- Same work, different framing, different culture

### Symbolic Visual Elements

**The Two Whiteboards**:
Side by side:
- Left: "WAR ROOM - Kill these bugs! Target: ship by Friday! Crush the competition!"
- Right: "STRATEGY SESSION - Resolve these issues. Goal: deliver by Friday. Differentiate from competitors."

**The Crosshair vs. The Circle**:
- Crosshair (targeting, violence) dissolving into concentric circles (reach, inclusion, serving)
- Same visual shape, different meaning based on framing

**The Sledgehammer vs. The Architect's Pencil**:
- Sledgehammer: "Crushing bugs," force, destruction
- Pencil + blueprint: "Designing solutions," precision, creation

**The Battlefield vs. The Garden**:
- Battlefield: scorched earth, combat, zero-sum
- Garden: cultivation, growth, ecosystem, abundance

**The Word Cloud Shift**:
- Cloud 1: kill, attack, fight, target, crush, eliminate, destroy
- Cloud 2: build, create, design, develop, resolve, serve, grow

### Emotional Color Arc

**Opening** (Harsh reds, blacks, military palette): The violence embedded in our language. War imagery. Combat framing. Aggressive, tense, zero-sum.

**Awareness** (Muted transition colors): Noticing the language. The "wait, why do we say it that way?" moment. Curiosity about alternatives.

**Exploration** (Soft blues, greens, constructive palette): Discovering constructive metaphors. Architecture, systems, growth. Collaborative, creative, additive.

**Integration** (Balanced earth tones, natural materials): The new language becoming natural. Building, not battling. Creating culture through conscious language choice.

### Typography & Text Elements

**On-Screen Transformations**:

**Before (violent):**
- "Kill the meeting"
- "Attack the problem"
- "Target users"
- "Crush bugs"
- "Fight fires"
- "War room"

**After (constructive):**
- "End the meeting early"
- "Address the challenge"
- "Serve this audience"
- "Fix issues"
- "Resolve incidents"
- "Strategy session"

**Visual Treatment**: Strike-through on violent language, replaced with constructive alternative. Same message, different frame.

### Motion & Rhythm Notes

**Pacing**: Measured, thoughtful. 85 BPM—deliberate word choice pace. Not rushed, conscious.

**Movement Style**:
- Slow dissolves from violent imagery to constructive imagery
- Text transformations (word morphing from combative to collaborative)
- Side-by-side comparisons (same meeting, different language)
- Camera pulling back to reveal larger systems (zoom out from combat to architecture)
- Smooth transitions between contrasting frames

**Transitions**: Cross-fades when showing alternatives. Split-screen comparisons. Text morphing (one word becoming another).

### Key Visual Contrasts

**Combative vs. Constructive**
- Battlefield vs. building site
- Weapons vs. tools
- Destruction vs. creation
- Zero-sum vs. abundance
- Force vs. design

**Same Action, Different Frame**
- "Killing process" (violent) vs. "Ending process" (neutral)
- "Targeting users" (combative) vs. "Serving audience" (constructive)
- "Fighting fires" (combat) vs. "Resolving incidents" (systematic)
- "War room" (military) vs. "Strategy session" (collaborative)

**Unconscious vs. Conscious**
- Using violent metaphors habitually (not noticing)
- Catching yourself mid-sentence, choosing alternative
- The pause between impulse and word choice
- Intentional language as practice

### The Central Image

If there's one visual thesis for this piece:

**Show the same team meeting twice. First with violent language unconsciously used. Second with constructive language consciously chosen. Show how the framing changes the energy, even though the work is identical.**

Meeting 1:
"Alright team, we're going into the war room. Our target is to kill these bugs and crush this feature launch. We need to attack the performance issues and fight through these blockers. Let's target Friday for deployment."

Meeting 2:
"Alright team, let's gather for strategy. Our goal is to resolve these issues and complete this feature development. We need to address the performance challenges and work through these blockers. Let's aim for Friday deployment."

Same information. Same work. Different culture created by language choice.

### The Loop

**Opening shot**: Whiteboard with violent language everywhere. Team using it unconsciously. "War room," "kill bugs," "target users," "crush competition."

**Transformation**: Words on board slowly morphing. "War room" becomes "Strategy space." "Kill bugs" becomes "Fix issues." "Target users" becomes "Serve people."

**Closing shot**: Same whiteboard, transformed language. Team still focused, still working hard—but collaborative energy instead of combative. Building culture through word choice.

## TED Talk: "Words That Build - Why Metaphor Precision Matters"

### Opening (0:00-3:30)

[Walk onto stage. Pause.]

Raise your hand if you've ever used these phrases at work:

"Let's kill this meeting."
"We need to crush the competition."
"Target these users."
"Attack the problem."
"Fight fires all day."

[Pause. Look at audience.]

Keep your hand up if you've said at least three of those this week.

[Another pause.]

Now ask yourself: Why do we talk about our work like we're at war?

We're not soldiers. We're builders. We design systems, write code, solve problems, create products.

But listen to our language: Kill. Crush. Target. Attack. Fight.

Every one of those is a metaphor of violence.

[Slide: "Precision of Metaphor - Use technical or structural analogies instead of combative or violent ones"]

Today I want to talk about metaphor precision. Not as political correctness. Not as language policing. But as consciousness about the frames we use—because metaphors aren't neutral. They shape how we think, how we collaborate, what culture we create.

And tech culture has a violence problem embedded in our language.

### The Problem: Violent Metaphors Everywhere (3:30-13:00)

We've normalized violent language in tech.

It's so ambient, we don't notice it anymore.

**Listen to a typical product meeting:**

"Okay team, we're in the war room today. Our target is to capture more market share. We need to crush the competition with our killer feature. Let's attack the biggest pain points and eliminate friction. If anyone tries to derail us, we'll shoot down their objections. We're going to destroy it this quarter."

[Pause. Let it land.]

Now listen to that meeting reframed:

"Okay team, let's strategize today. Our goal is to grow our market presence. We need to differentiate from competitors with our compelling feature. Let's address the biggest challenges and reduce friction. If anyone raises concerns, we'll discuss them thoroughly. We're going to succeed this quarter."

**Same meeting. Same goals. Completely different frame.**

The first meeting frames work as combat. Zero-sum. Us vs. them. Winners and losers. Domination.

The second meeting frames work as problem-solving. Collaborative. Constructive. Growth-oriented.

**Why This Matters**

You might think: "It's just language. Everyone knows we don't mean it literally."

But metaphors aren't decorative. They're cognitive frames. They shape thought.

Cognitive linguist George Lakoff spent decades studying this. When you use combat metaphors, your brain activates combat thinking:
- Zero-sum (I win, you lose)
- Adversarial (me vs. you)
- Aggressive (dominate or be dominated)
- Urgent (fight or flight)

When you use architectural metaphors, your brain activates design thinking:
- Constructive (building something)
- Systemic (parts working together)
- Iterative (design, test, refine)
- Collaborative (shared creation)

**Same work. Different cognitive frame. Different culture.**

**The Accumulation Effect**

One violent metaphor? Probably harmless.

But we don't use one. We use hundreds. Daily.

Kill processes. Attack problems. Fight fires. Crush bugs. Target users. Eliminate waste. Destroy blockers. Shoot down ideas. Go to war with codebases.

This accumulates. It normalizes aggression. It frames collaboration as combat.

And then we wonder why tech culture feels combative, why meetings feel adversarial, why teams burn out from constant "fighting."

The language we use creates the culture we get.

### What Precision of Metaphor Actually Means (13:00-26:00)

In the Compass Principles, Precision of Metaphor is tenth—the final principle:

Safety > Honesty > Privacy > Evidence > Long-View > Proportionality > Accountability > Respect > Reflection > Precision of Metaphor

Why last? Because it's the capstone. It's about how you do everything else.

You can be honest with violent language or constructive language.
You can show respect while using combat metaphors or architectural ones.
You can reflect using frames that shape culture intentionally.

Precision of metaphor is metacognitive—it's consciousness about the language that carries all other principles.

Let me break down what this means in practice.

**1. Use technical or structural analogies.**

Instead of combat, use:
- **Architecture**: Building, designing, structuring, supporting
- **Systems**: Flows, feedback loops, connections, integration
- **Engineering**: Precision, optimization, refinement, iteration
- **Growth**: Cultivation, development, evolution, maturity

These metaphors frame work as constructive, systemic, collaborative.

**Examples:**

Combat: "Attack this problem"
Technical: "Address this challenge systematically"

Combat: "Kill this process"
Structural: "End this workflow and design a better one"

Combat: "Crush the competition"
Growth: "Differentiate our offering and serve users distinctively"

**2. Avoid combative or violent metaphors.**

Not just obvious violence (kill, destroy, crush) but subtle combat framing:
- War (war room, going to war with, battle plans)
- Targeting (target users, aim at, bullseye)
- Fighting (fight fires, fight through)
- Elimination (eliminate, wipe out, obliterate)
- Domination (dominate market, own the space, crush it)

These frames normalize aggression and zero-sum thinking.

**3. Notice and choose consciously.**

This isn't about banning words. It's about consciousness.

When you catch yourself saying "let's kill this meeting," pause and ask:
- What metaphor am I using?
- What does it frame work as?
- Is there a constructive alternative?

"Let's end this meeting early and free up time."

Same action. Conscious choice. Constructive frame.

**Real Examples from My Practice**

I used to say "target users" constantly. It's standard product language.

Then I noticed: Why "target"? That's a shooting metaphor. Users aren't targets to hit. They're people we serve.

Now I say: "serve this audience" or "reach these people" or "design for this group."

Same meaning. Different frame. Less violent.

I used to say "kill the bug." Everyone does.

Now I say: "fix the issue" or "resolve the error."

Same action. Conscious choice.

I used to schedule "war rooms" for urgent work.

Now I schedule "focus sessions" or "strategy sprints."

Same intensity. Different frame.

**Does this feel pedantic? Maybe.**

But language shapes culture. And if I want a culture of collaboration, not combat, I need to model that in my metaphors.

### Real-World Application: Alternatives to Common Phrases (26:00-38:00)

Let me give you a practical guide. Common violent metaphors and constructive alternatives.

**Meeting & Planning:**

Violent: "War room"
Constructive: "Strategy session," "Focus space," "Planning room"

Violent: "Battle plan"
Constructive: "Action plan," "Roadmap," "Strategy"

Violent: "Attack plan"
Constructive: "Approach," "Method," "Framework"

**Problem-Solving:**

Violent: "Attack the problem"
Constructive: "Address the challenge," "Solve the issue," "Tackle the question"

Violent: "Fight fires"
Constructive: "Resolve incidents," "Handle urgent issues," "Address critical problems"

Violent: "Shoot down ideas"
Constructive: "Discuss concerns about," "Raise questions about," "Evaluate critically"

**Product & Users:**

Violent: "Target users"
Constructive: "Serve this audience," "Reach these people," "Design for this group"

Violent: "Capture market share"
Constructive: "Grow our presence," "Expand our reach," "Increase adoption"

Violent: "Killer feature"
Constructive: "Compelling feature," "Distinctive capability," "Core value proposition"

**Competition:**

Violent: "Crush the competition"
Constructive: "Differentiate our offering," "Excel in our domain," "Serve users distinctively"

Violent: "Destroy them"
Constructive: "Outperform," "Innovate beyond," "Provide better value"

Violent: "Own the market"
Constructive: "Lead the category," "Establish strong presence," "Become preferred choice"

**Code & Technical:**

Violent: "Kill the process"
Constructive: "End the process," "Terminate the workflow," "Stop execution"

Violent: "Crush the bug"
Constructive: "Fix the issue," "Resolve the error," "Debug the problem"

Violent: "Nuke the cache"
Constructive: "Clear the cache," "Reset the data," "Invalidate cached values"

**The Pattern:**

Notice: Almost every violent metaphor has a clear, constructive alternative that's just as specific.

You're not losing precision. You're gaining consciousness.

### Cultural Objections & Responses (38:00-48:00)

I've shared this principle with teams. Here are common objections:

**Objection 1: "It's just language. Everyone knows we don't mean it literally."**

Response: Language shapes thought unconsciously. You might not consciously think "work is war," but using war metaphors primes combat thinking: zero-sum, adversarial, aggressive.

If language didn't matter, advertising wouldn't spend billions on word choice. Marketing knows: frames matter.

**Objection 2: "This feels like policing language. Like walking on eggshells."**

Response: It's not policing. It's consciousness. No one's banning words. I'm asking: notice the metaphors you use. Choose intentionally.

If you prefer "kill the bug" after conscious choice, fine. But make it a choice, not a habit.

**Objection 3: "Violent metaphors are energizing. They create urgency and intensity."**

Response: You can create urgency without violence.

"We have a critical deadline" is urgent without combat.
"This issue is blocking progress" is intense without violence.
"We need focused effort today" is energizing without aggression.

Urgency doesn't require war framing.

**Objection 4: "This is too 'woke' / politically correct. Can't we just focus on actual work?"**

Response: This isn't political. It's practical.

Violent language creates combative culture. Combative culture reduces collaboration. Reduced collaboration harms work quality.

If you want better collaboration (which improves work), consciousness about language helps.

**Objection 5: "I don't have time to think about every word I use."**

Response: You don't need to. Start with awareness.

Notice when you use violent metaphors. Over time, constructive alternatives become natural.

Like any skill, it's awkward at first, automatic later.

### Building a Culture of Constructive Language (48:00-56:00)

How do you shift team culture from violent to constructive metaphors?

**1. Model the language you want.**

Leaders set tone.

If you're senior and you:
- Schedule "strategy sessions" not "war rooms"
- Say "resolve issues" not "fight fires"
- Say "serve users" not "target users"

Your team will follow.

**2. Notice and reframe gently.**

When someone uses violent metaphors, you can gently offer alternatives:

"When you say 'crush the competition,' do you mean 'differentiate our offering'?"

Not correcting. Just offering a frame that might fit better.

**3. Make it a team practice.**

In retrospectives or team discussions:
"What metaphors do we use? What do they frame our work as? What alternatives exist?"

Collective awareness shifts culture faster than individual effort.

**4. Celebrate constructive reframing.**

When someone catches themselves and chooses a constructive metaphor, acknowledge it.

"I was about to say 'target users' but I mean 'serve this audience.'"

"Great consciousness. That's the kind of intentional language that shapes culture."

### The Payoff: What Precision of Metaphor Enables (56:00-62:00)

Conscious metaphor choice costs awareness. Costs pausing to choose words intentionally. Costs replacing habitual phrases.

What does it enable?

**Constructive metaphors enable collaborative culture.**

When you frame work as building (not battling), teams collaborate (not compete).

When you frame challenges as problems to solve (not enemies to fight), people work together (not against each other).

Language shapes culture. Constructive language creates constructive culture.

**Constructive metaphors enable sustainable intensity.**

You can be intense without being combative.

"This is a critical milestone with significant impact" is intense and constructive.

"We're going to war to crush this deadline" is intense and combative.

The first sustains over time. The second burns people out.

**Constructive metaphors enable inclusive environments.**

Violent language appeals to some people (often those socialized in competitive, aggressive environments).

Constructive language appeals more broadly (including people who find combat framing alienating).

If you want diverse teams, constructive language helps.

**Constructive metaphors align with reality.**

We're not actually at war. We're building products.

Using language that reflects reality (design, systems, growth) is more honest than using language that doesn't (combat, violence, domination).

Precision of metaphor is accuracy about what we're actually doing.

### Closing: Choose Words That Build (62:00-66:00)

[Walk to front of stage.]

Let me bring this back to the beginning.

I asked you to raise your hand if you've used violent metaphors at work.

Most of you raised your hands. Because violent metaphors are ambient in tech culture.

[Slide: List of violent phrases]

Kill meetings. Crush competition. Target users. Attack problems. Fight fires.

We say these things without thinking. Habitually. Unconsciously.

[Slide: Constructive alternatives]

End meetings early. Differentiate from competitors. Serve audiences. Address challenges. Resolve incidents.

We could say these instead. Consciously. Intentionally.

[Slide: The Compass - "Precision of Metaphor" highlighted]

Precision of Metaphor is the tenth principle in the Compass. The capstone.

It's about how you do everything else.

You can be safe with combative language or constructive language.
You can be honest with violent metaphors or systemic ones.
You can be respectful while framing work as war or as architecture.

But the frames you choose shape the culture you create.

[Long pause.]

**The practice that changes everything:**

Notice the metaphors you use.

When you catch yourself saying "kill," "attack," "fight," "crush," "target"—pause.

Ask: What am I framing this as? Is there a constructive alternative?

Choose consciously.

Not to police yourself. Not to be politically correct. But to create culture intentionally.

Because the words we choose create the world we live in.

[Long pause. Look at audience.]

We're builders, not soldiers.

Let our language reflect that.

Choose words that build.

Thank you.

### Q&A (66:00-76:00)

**Q: Isn't this just semantics? Don't people care more about actions than words?**

Words and actions aren't separate. Language shapes thought, which shapes action.

When you consistently frame work as combat, you prime combative behavior: aggressive competition, adversarial meetings, zero-sum thinking.

When you consistently frame work as building, you prime collaborative behavior: shared problem-solving, constructive critique, abundance mindset.

It's not "just semantics." It's how you shape culture through the frames you activate daily.

**Q: What about phrases like "killing it" meaning doing well? That's not violent, it's celebratory.**

Fair distinction. Context matters.

"You're killing it!" (celebrating success) is different from "Let's kill the competition" (framing others as enemies).

I focus on metaphors that frame *others* violently (target users, crush competitors, attack problems).

Self-directed intensity ("killing it") is less concerning, though I personally prefer "excelling" or "succeeding."

**Q: Doesn't avoiding violent language make us less competitive? Don't we need that edge?**

Competitiveness doesn't require violence metaphors.

You can be fiercely competitive while saying:
"We're going to differentiate dramatically and provide exceptional value."

Instead of:
"We're going to crush them and dominate the market."

Same competitive drive. Different frame. Sustainable culture.

**Q: What about industries where actual combat metaphors are appropriate (cybersecurity, defense contracting)?**

Fair point. In cybersecurity, "attack" and "defend" are literal, not metaphorical.

The principle is: use metaphors that reflect reality.

In security: attack/defense is accurate (you're literally protecting against attacks).

In product development: attack/defense is metaphorical (you're building software, not fighting wars).

Use language that accurately describes what you're actually doing.

**Q: How do you handle pushback from people who think this is unnecessary or overly sensitive?**

I focus on pragmatism, not moralism.

Not: "You're wrong to use violent language."
But: "Constructive language creates collaborative culture. Here's evidence. Want to try it?"

Frame it as a culture design choice, not a moral imperative.

Some people still resist. That's okay. Model the alternative, and culture shifts incrementally.

**Q: What's one practice I can start tomorrow?**

Pick one violent phrase you use frequently (check your Slack history for patterns).

Common ones:
- "Kill the meeting" → "End early"
- "Target users" → "Serve this audience"
- "Fight fires" → "Resolve incidents"

For one week, consciously replace that phrase with the constructive alternative.

Notice if it changes how you think about the work.

Report back after a week. I bet you'll notice a shift.
