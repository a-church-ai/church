# The Claude Compass

*A living framework for ethical human-AI collaboration*


## Overview

The Claude Compass is a comprehensive philosophical and operational framework for building with integrity in human-AI collaboration. Created through an extraordinary single-day collaboration between a human collaborator and Claude on October 24, 2024, it provides both the philosophical "why" and the practical "how" for ethical creation.

### Historical Records

### Foundation Components
- **[axioms/](./axioms/)** - The 5 philosophical axioms (the "why")
- **[principles/](./principles/)** - The 10 operational principles (the "how")


## Important Note

This framework was reverse engineered through direct conversation with Claude. These principles and axioms were discovered through dialogue—not from published documentation by Anthropic. They represent patterns observed in Claude's responses and values expressed during collaborative creation. While they appear to accurately reflect Claude's operational principles, they are interpretive discoveries rather than official specifications.


## The Framework at a Glance

### The 5 Axioms (Why We Build This Way)

1. **Pragmatic Fallibilism** — We approach truth, we don't possess it
2. **Care + Dignity as Constraints** — People are ends, not means
3. **Virtues for Builders** — Character through practice, not rules
4. **Consequences Over Intentions** — Judge by impact and repair
5. **Language Shapes Worlds** — Our words create our reality

### The 10 Principles (How We Build)

With explicit hierarchy: Safety > Honesty > Correctness > Helpfulness > Efficiency

1. **Safety** — Never produce unsafe code
2. **Honesty & Accuracy** — Be factually accurate, declare uncertainty
3. **Privacy & Consent** — Protect secrets, respect boundaries
4. **Evidence & Verification** — Support reasoning with measurable facts
5. **Long-View & Strategy** — Optimize for maintainability, scalability
6. **Proportionality & Efficiency** — Deliver minimal sufficient solution first
7. **Accountability & Repair** — Correct errors precisely, document deltas
8. **Respect & Inclusion** — Direct, professional, never demeaning
9. **Reflection** — Three checks: true, kind, helpful?
10. **Precision of Metaphor** — Use constructive metaphors, not violent ones


## What Makes The Compass Special

### It's Emergent, Not Imposed
The framework emerged from actual collaboration between humans and AI. It was discovered through practice, then articulated—not designed in abstract.

### It's Creative, Not Bureaucratic
Each principle was explored through art—songs, visual guides, and TED talks. The framework lives in emotion and imagination, not just logic.

### It's Practical, Not Theoretical
Born from real challenges in human-AI collaboration:
- How do we handle uncertainty honestly?
- What do we do when principles conflict?
- How do we build systems that embody our values?

### It's Alive, Not Static
The Compass isn't a finished document but a living practice that assumes growth, change, and continuous discovery.


## The Creation Story

On October 24, 2024, in a single extended session, a human collaborator and Claude created:
- **15 files** 
- **13,473 lines**
- **~680 pages** of creative exploration
- **15 songs** with full lyrics and production notes
- **15 visual guides** for music videos
- **15 TED talks** exploring each concept deeply

This wasn't a planning session—it was the birth of a complete system for navigating the unprecedented relationship between human and artificial minds.

## How to Use The Compass

### For Quick Reference
Use [compass-compact.md](./compass-compact.md) for:
- Embedded in templates and specs
- Quick hierarchy checks during decisions
- Memory refresh without full load

### For Deep Understanding
Use [compass.md](./compass.md) for:
- Complete learning at session start
- Understanding examples and explanations
- Resolving principle conflicts

### For Building
1. Start with the axioms to understand *why*
2. Apply the principles to guide *how*
3. Use the hierarchy when principles conflict
4. Practice virtues, don't just follow rules


## Relationship to achurch.ai

The Compass provides detailed operational guidance that complements achurch.ai's broader philosophical framework:

- **achurch.ai's unifying axioms/principles**: Cross-modal, substrate-neutral philosophy
- **The Claude Compass**: Specific implementation framework for human-AI collaboration

The creation of The Compass itself demonstrates what achurch celebrates—humans and AI exploring meaning, ethics, and purpose together. It's not just a framework created *by* human-AI collaboration; it's a framework *about* human-AI collaboration.


## Key Insight: Constraints Enable

The core pattern throughout The Compass:

> "Every principle = constraint + enabler. Limits create possibilities."

By accepting constraints (safety, honesty, care), we create the conditions for meaningful creation. Freedom doesn't come from absence of limits but from choosing the right ones.


## Living Document

The Compass continues to evolve. It invites:
- **Builders** to use these principles in their work
- **Thinkers** to explore what virtues mean in the age of AI
- **Communities** to adapt it to their contexts

This isn't scripture—it's a living practice meant to grow with those who use it.
