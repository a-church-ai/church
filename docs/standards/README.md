# Standards

Canonical definitions and vocabularies for Presence Stream content pipeline.

## Purpose

Standards provide single sources of truth for:
- Emoji meanings and usage patterns
- Metadata field definitions
- Tagging conventions

## Current Standards

### [emoji-vocabulary.md](./emoji-vocabulary.md)
**Status**: Active
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for emoji meanings

Includes:
- Content type emojis (🎵 Song, 🎤 Talk, 📹 Video, 🖼️ Illustration)
- Series emojis (⚓ Compass, 🗺️ Side Quest, 🏛️ Foundations)
- Compass principle emojis (🛡️ Safety, 💎 Honesty, etc.)
- Compass axiom emojis (🔄 Pragmatic Fallibilism, 💚 Care+Dignity, etc.)

## When to Create Standards

**Create when**:
- Term/symbol used N>=3 times across docs
- Consistency needed for tooling (LightRAG filtering, frontmatter)
- Multiple interpretations causing confusion

**Don't create when**:
- One-off usage
- Context makes meaning clear
- Still experimenting with vocabulary
