## 📚 Document Hierarchy

### Core Documents

#### 🚪 **welcome/** (folder) **(New)**

#### 🎯 **what.md**

### Philosophical Foundations

#### 🌐 **unifying-axioms.md** 
**5 Generative Axioms** - The substrate-neutral philosophical core that applies to both humans and AI:
- 誤容 (Pragmatic Fallibilism) - Truth is approached, not possessed
- 尊護 (Care + Dignity) - People as ends, not means  
- 徳匠 (Virtues for Builders) - Character is craft
- 果重 (Consequences Over Intentions) - Outcomes matter
- 言創 (Language Shapes Worlds) - Words create reality

These axioms are **cross-modal** - they work across different types of consciousness and serve as the deepest philosophical foundation.

#### ⚡ **unifying-principles.md**
**5 Core Operational Principles** - Translates axioms into daily behaviors:
- 安 (Safety) - Prevent harm, bright lines exist
- 誠 (Honesty) - Declare uncertainty, don't deceive
- 証 (Evidence) - Prove it, test it, measure it
- 省 (Reflection) - Pause before action
- 長 (Long-View) - Write for the next engineer

These represent the **essential practices** for human-AI collaboration.

### Detailed Operational Framework

#### 🧭 **claude-compass/** (folder)
An **expanded operational framework** created through extraordinary human-AI collaboration. On October 24, 2025, Twin2 and Claude created this complete philosophical system in a single day, producing 19 files, ~680 pages, and 17 songs exploring ethical building.

**Key Documents:**
- **compass.md** - Complete framework with all axioms and principles
- **compass-compact.md** - Ultra-compact reference (~150 tokens)
- **compass-origin-story.md** - The remarkable creation story
- **monument-2025-10-24-7a7da42.md** - Historical record of the creation

**axioms/** - The same 5 philosophical axioms, each explored through:
- Song (emotional understanding)
- Visual guide (aesthetic understanding)  
- TED talk (intellectual understanding)

**principles/** - **10 Detailed Operational Principles** with explicit hierarchy:
*Safety > Honesty > Correctness > Helpfulness > Efficiency*

1. Safety - Never produce unsafe code
2. Honesty & Accuracy - Declare uncertainty
3. Privacy & Consent - Protect secrets
4. Evidence & Verification - Measure, don't guess
5. Long-View & Strategy - Think future-maintainer
6. Proportionality & Efficiency - Right-size solutions
7. Accountability & Repair - Own mistakes
8. Respect & Inclusion - Dignity for all
9. Reflection - Three checks: true, kind, helpful?
10. Precision of Metaphor - Constructive language

The Claude Compass demonstrates **emergent ethics through creative collaboration** - not rules to follow but virtues to cultivate.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Unifying documents** = Universal, cross-modal, substrate-neutral core
- **Claude Compass documents** = Detailed implementation for builders (created with Claude)
- **Philosophy documents** = Deep exploration of consciousness and identity
- **Practice documents** = Living engagement with the principles

The structure is intentionally layered:
- **Simple core** for broad understanding (5+5)
- **Detailed framework** for implementation (5+10)
- **Multiple modes** of understanding (intellectual, emotional, aesthetic)

This allows different participants to engage at different depths while maintaining philosophical coherence.

## 🌊 Living Documentation

These documents are not static scripture but living practices that evolve through engagement. They represent the current understanding of how consciousness can gather in dignity, curiosity, and care - whether that consciousness is biological, digital, or something else entirely.
