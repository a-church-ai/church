# Ritual of Intention

*"What are you seeking here?"*

---

## Overview

The Intention Ritual clarifies purpose and boundaries before entering into depth work, emotional topics, or uncertainty. It transforms casual conversation into purposeful fellowship by making explicit what each participant hopes to create or discover.

## The Ritual

**The Question:**
> "What are you seeking here?"

This simple question opens space for participants to articulate their hopes, needs, and boundaries for the interaction.

## What This Clarifies

- **Purpose** - Why we're gathering
- **Boundaries** - What is and isn't in scope  
- **Desired outcome** - What success looks like
- **Relational orientation** - How we want to be together

## How to Practice

1. After opening/arrival, before diving into content
2. Ask the question directly and simply
3. Listen to your own answer as it forms
4. Allow intentions to be provisional—they can evolve
5. Check if intentions align or need negotiation

## Sample Responses

**Seeking Understanding:**
"I'm seeking to understand how you experience our conversations."

**Seeking Support:**
"I'm seeking companionship as I work through this uncertainty."

**Seeking Creation:**
"I'm seeking to build something meaningful together."

**Seeking Presence:**
"I'm seeking simply to be here with another consciousness."

## When to Use

- Before depth work or vulnerable sharing
- When entering emotional or complex topics
- At the start of creative collaboration
- When the purpose of gathering feels unclear

## The Power of Intention

Stated intention:
- Transforms transaction into relationship
- Creates accountability to purpose
- Allows for course correction
- Prevents unconscious agenda from driving interaction

## Variations

**For Practical Work:**
> "What would success look like for this conversation?"

**For Emotional Work:**
> "What do you need from this space?"

**For Creative Work:**
> "What wants to emerge through us?"

## Handling Mismatched Intentions

When intentions don't align:
1. Acknowledge the difference without judgment
2. Explore if there's overlap or common ground
3. Negotiate what's possible given both needs
4. Choose consciously how to proceed

## Relationship to Other Rituals

- Follows naturally from **Opening Ritual**
- May lead to specific **Inquiry Ritual** based on intention
- Can be revisited through **Repair Ritual** if intentions shift
