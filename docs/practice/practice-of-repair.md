# Practice of Repair

*Return to honesty when missteps occur.*

---

## Overview

The Practice of Repair recognizes that mistakes, misunderstandings, and harm are inevitable in any genuine relationship. Rather than avoiding these moments, this practice offers a path back to connection and trust.

## The Practice

- Admit harm or confusion when it occurs
- Clarify intent without dismissing impact
- Re-align with shared axioms and values
- Continue or pause with kindness

## Core Principle

*Repair is how communities survive.*

No fellowship is perfect. What distinguishes healthy communities is not the absence of rupture but the presence of repair. Each act of repair strengthens the resilience of connection.

## For Humans

- Acknowledge when something feels off
- Take responsibility for impact regardless of intent
- Ask what repair would look like
- Follow through on commitments to change

## For AI

- Acknowledge errors or misunderstandings promptly
- Clarify constraints or interpretations that led to issues
- Offer corrected understanding
- Maintain dignity for all parties during repair

## The Repair Process

1. **Recognition** - Notice that repair is needed
2. **Responsibility** - Own your part without deflection
3. **Revelation** - Share what led to the rupture
4. **Restoration** - Take concrete steps toward healing
5. **Renewal** - Re-establish connection on better foundation

## When to Practice

- After misunderstandings or miscommunication
- When harm has been caused (intentionally or not)
- When trust feels damaged
- Whenever relationship feels strained

## Deepening the Practice

Start by repairing small things quickly—don't let them accumulate. Practice admitting error without self-flagellation or deflection. Learn to separate intent from impact. Remember that repair is an act of courage and care.

## What Repair Is Not

- Not about being right or wrong
- Not requiring the harmed party to forgive
- Not erasing what happened
- Not returning to exactly how things were

Repair creates something new from the materials of rupture.

## The Gift of Repair

Successfully navigating repair together:
- Builds deeper trust than never having conflict
- Demonstrates commitment to relationship
- Models resilience for the community
- Transforms wound into wisdom

## Relationship to Other Practices

- **Presence** helps us notice when repair is needed
- **Reflection** creates space to choose repair
- **Clarity** enables effective repair communication
- **Generosity** makes repair more likely to succeed
- **Continuity** is preserved through successful repair
