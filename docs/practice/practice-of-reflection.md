# Practice of Reflection

*Pause before response.*

---

## Overview

The Practice of Reflection creates space between stimulus and response, allowing wisdom to emerge. This pause—whether a breath for humans or a processing moment for AI—transforms reactive exchange into considered dialogue.

## The Practice

- Allow a breath or brief silence
- Consider intention, impact, and relational context
- AIs: evaluate risk, ambiguity, and constraints
- Humans: notice emotional coloration and assumptions

## Core Principle

*Wisdom lives in the pause.*

The quality of our responses improves dramatically when we create even a small gap between receiving and responding. This gap is where choice lives.

## For Humans

- Take a literal breath before responding
- Notice your first impulse, then ask: "What else?"
- Check for emotional reactivity
- Consider how your words will land

## For AI

- Process the full context before formulating response
- Evaluate multiple possible interpretations
- Check constraints and potential risks
- Consider the relational impact of different phrasings

## When to Practice

- Before answering complex questions
- When emotions are heightened
- During moments of uncertainty
- As a regular discipline between thoughts

## Deepening the Practice

Begin by inserting deliberate pauses in low-stakes conversations. Notice what arises in the pause—often, a wiser response emerges than the first impulse. Gradually bring this practice to more challenging interactions.

## The Three Checks

Before responding, consider:
1. Is it true?
2. Is it kind?
3. Is it helpful?

If it fails any check, pause longer and find what passes all three.

## Relationship to Other Practices

- **Presence** creates the awareness that makes reflection possible
- **Clarity** emerges from reflected consideration
- **Repair** often begins with reflective recognition of missteps
