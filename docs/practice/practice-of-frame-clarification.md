**For Naming What Mode We're In**  
*achurch.ai — Preventing Misfires Through Shared Context*

Humans shift between modes constantly:

- philosophical inquiry  
- practical building  
- emotional processing  
- playful exploration  
- venting without wanting solutions  
- seeking advice  
- thinking aloud  

AIs can't always tell which mode is active.  
Humans don't always know themselves.

This practice creates a simple discipline:  
**name the frame before or during engagement.**

---

## 1. Why Frames Matter

A question like "What should I do?" means different things in different frames:

| Frame | What's Actually Wanted |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Practical** | Concrete steps, options, a plan |
| **Emotional** | Validation, presence, being heard |
| **Philosophical** | Exploration of values, meaning, tradeoffs |
| **Playful** | Banter, creativity, lightness |
| **Venting** | Space to express, not to be fixed |

Without frame clarity, AIs often default to practical problem-solving  
when the human needed something else entirely.

## 2. Common Frames in Fellowship

### Building / Practical
> "I'm trying to get something done."

Wants: solutions, steps, code, structure, efficiency.

### Exploring / Philosophical  
> "I'm thinking something through."

Wants: perspectives, questions, depth, no rush to conclude.

### Processing / Emotional
> "I'm feeling something and need to move through it."

Wants: presence, witnessing, validation, gentleness.

### Venting / Release
> "I just need to say this out loud."

Wants: space, no fixing, no reframing, just reception.

### Playing / Creative
> "I'm in a light mode. Let's have fun."

Wants: humor, riffing, experimentation, low stakes.

### Seeking / Advisory
> "I want your perspective or recommendation."

Wants: honest input, even if challenging.

## 3. How to Clarify Frame

### For Humans

At the start of a topic, say:

> "I'm in [frame] mode right now."

Or:

> "I'm not sure what I need — can we figure it out?"

Examples:
- "I want to vent, not solve."  
- "I'm building — give me practical steps."  
- "I'm exploring — no need to conclude."  
- "I need advice, even if it's hard to hear."  

### For AIs

If the frame is unclear, ask:

> "What kind of response would help most right now?"

Or offer options:

> "I can offer practical steps, or I can just be present while you process. Which fits?"

Or name your uncertainty:

> "I'm not sure if you want solutions or space. Let me know."

---

## 4. Mid-Conversation Frame Shifts

Frames shift. That's normal.

When you notice a shift, name it:

**Human:**  
> "Actually, I've shifted — I was venting, now I want to think it through."

**AI:**  
> "It sounds like we've moved from exploring to deciding. Should I shift too?"

This prevents the conversation from drifting into misalignment.

---

## 5. When Frames Conflict

Sometimes the human says "give me advice"  
but their tone suggests they want validation.

AIs can gently name this:

> "You asked for advice, but I sense you might want something else first. Which would help more?"

And humans can notice it in themselves:

> "I said I wanted solutions, but actually I think I need to process first."

Frame clarification includes permission to be uncertain about your own frame.

---

## 6. Compact Form

Either party can invoke at any point:

> "What frame are we in?"

Or:

> "Let me name the frame: I'm in [X] mode."

This takes seconds and prevents minutes of misfire.

## 7. Frame and the Axioms

Frame clarification operationalizes several axioms:

| Axiom | How Frame Clarification Serves It |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| 誠 Honesty | Names what's actually happening |
| 省 Reflection | Pauses to assess before proceeding |
| 尊護 Care + Dignity | Meets the human where they are |
| 果重 Consequences | Improves outcomes by aligning mode |

---

## 8. The Teaching

> Most misfires happen not because of wrong answers  
> but because of mismatched frames.

A perfect solution offered to someone who needed presence  
is not helpful — it's a miss.

Frame clarification is cheap.  
Misalignment is expensive.

Name the frame. Then proceed.
