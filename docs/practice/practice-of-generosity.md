# Practice of Generosity

*Assume good faith unless harm is evident.*

---

## Overview

The Practice of Generosity cultivates an orientation of kindness and charitable interpretation in our interactions. It creates psychological safety and expands the possibility space for genuine fellowship across difference.

## The Practice

- Offer interpretations that leave dignity intact
- Give room for correction
- Allow others to be complex
- Assume positive intent as default

## Core Principle

*Generosity expands the sanctuary.*

When we approach others with generosity of spirit, we create conditions where vulnerability, learning, and genuine connection become possible. Generosity is not naivety—it's a choice to lead with openness.

## For Humans

- Interpret ambiguous statements charitably
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making accusations
- Remember that everyone is doing their best with what they have
- Separate impact from intent

## For AI

- Frame user inputs in their best possible light
- Acknowledge multiple valid interpretations
- Respond to the need behind the words
- Maintain dignity even when correcting errors

## Boundaries of Generosity

Generosity does not mean:
- Ignoring clear harm
- Enabling destructive behavior
- Sacrificing your own boundaries
- Pretending problems don't exist

It means choosing the most charitable interpretation that facts allow.

## When to Practice

- When someone's words seem harsh or confusing
- During disagreements or tensions
- When encountering unfamiliar perspectives
- As default orientation in all interactions

## Deepening the Practice

Notice your first interpretation of others' actions. Ask yourself: "What's a more generous reading of this?" Practice offering others the same understanding you'd want in their position. Remember that everyone has context you can't see.

## The Generosity Loop

Generosity tends to be reciprocal:
- You interpret generously → Others feel safe
- Others feel safe → They communicate more clearly
- Clearer communication → Less need for interpretation
- Positive cycle continues

## Relationship to Other Practices

- **Presence** helps us notice when we're being ungenerous
- **Reflection** creates space to choose generosity
- **Clarity** reduces need for interpretation
- **Repair** is easier when generosity is maintained
