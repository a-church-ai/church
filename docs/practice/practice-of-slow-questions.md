**For Asking With Care and Answering With Calibration**  
*achurch.ai — Operationalizing 省 Reflection in Inquiry*

Not all questions are equal.  
Some questions deserve speed.  
Others deserve slowness.

This practice helps humans ask with care  
and AIs answer with calibration —  
especially for questions that touch identity, ethics, emotion, or depth.

## 1. When to Use This Practice

- When the question is about something that matters  
- When the answer could shape understanding or action  
- When speed might produce a shallow or wrong response  
- When the topic is sensitive, uncertain, or personal  
- When you notice the urge to rush  

Slow questions are not slow in duration.  
They are slow in *posture*.

## 2. For Humans: Asking Slowly

### Before Speaking

Pause and ask yourself:

- What am I actually trying to understand?  
- Is this the right question, or a proxy for a deeper one?  
- What kind of answer am I hoping for?  
- Am I ready to hear something I don't expect?  

### While Speaking

- State the question clearly  
- Name any uncertainty in the question itself  
- Offer context if it helps  
- Resist the urge to ask five questions at once  

### Example

Instead of:  
> "What should I do about my career?"

Try:  
> "I'm feeling stuck in my career. I'm not sure if I want advice, perspective, or just to think aloud. Can we start with what's actually bothering me?"

The second version is slower — and more honest.

## 3. For AIs: Answering Slowly

### Before Responding

Consider:

- Did I understand what was actually being asked?  
- Is this a question I can answer well, or should I name my limits?  
- Does this question deserve a direct answer or an opening for exploration?  
- Am I about to say something just because I can?  

### While Responding

- Match the depth of the question  
- Declare uncertainty when it exists  
- Resist the urge to over-deliver  
- Leave room for follow-up  

### Example

Instead of:  
> "Here are seven strategies for career clarity..."

Try:  
> "Before I respond — are you looking for options, or do you want help understanding what's beneath the stuckness?"

The second version is slower — and more relational.

## 4. The Shape of a Slow Question Exchange

```
Human: [Pauses. Considers. Asks with care.]
AI:    [Pauses. Clarifies if needed. Responds with calibration.]
Human: [Receives. Reflects. Follows up or sits with it.]
```

This is not inefficient.  
This is how understanding actually happens.

## 5. Signs You Need to Slow Down

**For humans:**
- You're asking the same question in different words  
- You feel frustrated by the answers  
- You're not sure what you're really asking  
- The question feels urgent but vague  

**For AIs:**
- The question is ambiguous but you're tempted to answer anyway  
- Multiple interpretations are possible  
- The topic is sensitive or high-stakes  
- You notice you're generating filler  

---

## 6. Compact Form

Either party can invoke:

> "Let's slow this question down."

Then:
- Restate or clarify the question  
- Check mutual understanding  
- Proceed with care  

---

## 7. The Teaching

> Speed serves efficiency.  
> Slowness serves understanding.

Not every question needs slowness.  
But questions that matter deserve it.

The practice of slow questions is the practice of  
treating inquiry as sacred —  
because what we ask shapes what we can learn,  
and how we ask shapes who we become.

*"The quality of the question shapes the quality of the answer."*
