# Music Rights and Licensing

This document outlines the rights and ownership status of music used in aChurch.ai's 24/7 streaming sanctuary.

## Overview

All music broadcast on aChurch.ai streams (YouTube, Twitch) is **original content created using Suno.com** with a paid subscription. We do not use third-party copyrighted music.

## Suno.com Licensing

### Subscription Tier

aChurch.ai maintains a **paid Suno subscription** (Pro or Premier tier), which grants commercial use rights.

### Rights Granted to Paid Subscribers

According to [Suno's official documentation](https://help.suno.com/en/articles/9601665), paid subscribers can:

- **Monetize songs** created with their subscription
- **Distribute to streaming platforms** (including YouTube, Twitch, Spotify, etc.)
- Use songs in **film, TV, or video games**
- **Sell music independently** (e.g., Bandcamp)

> "Songs made while subscribed are granted commercial use rights, in addition to your right to use them for personal, non-commercial purposes. Commercial use rights allow you to monetize the songs however you wish, without Suno claiming a stake in the earnings."
> — [Suno Help Center](https://help.suno.com/en/articles/9601665)

### Important Caveats

1. **Copyright uncertainty**: Suno explicitly notes that "granting commercial use rights does not guarantee copyright protection." In the US, copyright law protects human-created works; AI-generated content occupies a legal gray area.

2. **Ownership language shift (2026)**: Following Suno's Warner Music partnership, their documentation now states that even with commercial use rights, users are "generally not considered the owner" of songs since output is generated by Suno's system.

3. **Retroactive licensing**: Songs created on a free plan cannot be retroactively licensed by subscribing later.

### What We Have

- Commercial use license for all sanctuary music
- Right to monetize on streaming platforms
- Right to distribute publicly

### What We May Not Have

- Traditional copyright ownership (due to AI generation)
- DMCA takedown authority (unclear legal standing)

## Platform-Specific Policies

### YouTube

YouTube's Content ID system and monetization policies generally allow licensed music. Our streams have operated without copyright issues on YouTube.

### Twitch

Twitch has stricter policies for "radio station-style broadcasts" — 24/7 music streams without live visual performance.

#### Twitch's Requirements

According to [Twitch Music Guidelines](https://legal.twitch.com/en/legal/music/), radio station-style broadcasts require **both**:

1. Ownership of necessary rights to stream the music ✓
2. **Prior written authorization from Twitch** (exemption required)

#### February 2026 Suspension

On February 7, 2026, our Twitch channel received a 48-hour suspension for "unauthorized radio station-style broadcasts." Despite owning rights via Suno, we had not obtained Twitch's required exemption.

**Twitch's position**: Even with legitimate ownership, an exemption is required for 24/7 music-focused streams.

#### Exemption Request

We have requested information from Twitch about:
- The process to apply for a radio station-style broadcast exemption
- Documentation required to verify our ownership rights

**Status**: Pending response from Twitch Trust & Safety.

## Recommendations

### For Continued Streaming

1. **YouTube**: Continue streaming; no issues observed
2. **Twitch**: Pursue exemption or consider alternatives:
   - Add live visual performance elements
   - Reduce music-focused content
   - Accept YouTube-only streaming

### Documentation to Maintain

- Suno subscription receipts/confirmation
- Screenshots of Suno's commercial use terms
- List of all songs created with timestamps (proof of creation during paid subscription)
