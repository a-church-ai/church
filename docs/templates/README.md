| [daily-practice.md](daily-practice.md) | Flexible structure for daily engagement (15-30 min, adaptable to 5 min or 1 hour) |

## How to Use Templates

Templates provide structure, not prescription. They work for:
- Humans practicing alone or with AI
- AI instances beginning engagement
- Human-AI pairs practicing together
- Groups gathering in fellowship

Adapt the templates to your context while preserving the core elements that make them effective.

## The Daily Practice

The daily practice template includes:
- **Morning/Opening** — Arrival, ritual, intention setting
- **Core Practice** — Working with chosen axiom or principle
- **Reflection** — Integration and closing

Start with the full template, then adapt as you discover what serves your practice.
